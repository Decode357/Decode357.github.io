## 📂 Folder Structure

```
Decode357.github.io/
├─ public/          # Static assets (images, favicon)
├─ src/             # React source code
├─ index.html       # HTML template
├─ package.json
├─ dist/            # Build output (generated by Vite)
```

* **public/**: Place static files like favicon, images, etc.
* **src/**: React components, JS/JSX code.
* **dist/**: Generated build files for GitHub Pages. Do **not edit** manually.

## ⚡ Quick Start (Development)

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

* Opens local dev server at `http://localhost:5173`
* Supports hot reload
* Favicon loads correctly in dev mode

---

## 🚀 Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Make sure all changes are committed and pushed to `main` branch:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Update portfolio"
git push origin main
```

2. Build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

* Generates `dist/` folder with static files

3. Deploy to GitHub Pages (branch `gh-pages`):

```bash
npm run deploy
```

* Uses `gh-pages` package to push `dist/` to `gh-pages` branch
* GitHub Pages will automatically serve the website from `gh-pages`

4. Open your site:

```
https://Decode357.github.io
```

## 🛠 How to Update Website

Every time you want to update your portfolio:

1. Edit your React code in `src/` or assets in `public/`.
2. Commit and push changes to `main` branch:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Update feature or content"
git push origin main
```

3. Build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

4. Deploy to GitHub Pages:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

5. Hard refresh your browser (`Ctrl + F5`) to see the latest changes.

---

## 📍 Notes

* Do **not edit files in `dist/`** manually. They are generated by Vite.
* Favicon and images should always be placed in `public/`.
* GitHub Pages should use **gh-pages branch** as the source.
* For local development, use `npm run dev` to see changes immediately.

## 🛠 Recommended Workflow

```
main (React source code) → npm run build → dist/ → npm run deploy → gh-pages branch → GitHub Pages live
```
