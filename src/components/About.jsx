                I'm a motivated and enthusiastic junior full-stack developer with a strong passion for building web applications. 
                Even though I'm a recent graduate, I enjoy learning new technologies and continuously improving my skills to create clean, efficient, and user-friendly solutions. 
                </p> 
                <p>
                With foundational experience in both frontend and backend development, 
                I focus on writing maintainable code and understanding how each part of a system works together. I'm excited to grow, take on new challenges, and contribute to real-world projects that make an impact.
